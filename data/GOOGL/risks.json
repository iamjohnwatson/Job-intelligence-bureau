Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard, which is effective for our 2025 annual period, will be applied retrospectively. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\u2019s expenses. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures. In September 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-06 \"Intangibles: Goodwill and Other\u2012Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Internal-Use Software\" to modernize the accounting for software costs under Subtopic 350-40, Intangibles\u2012Goodwill and Other\u2012Internal-Use Software (referred to as \u201cinternal-use software\u201d). Upon adoption, we will be required to account for internal-use software under the updated capitalization criteria. The standard is effective for our interim and annual 2028 periods, with early adoption permitted. The standard can be applied either prospectively, retrospectively, or under a modified transition approach. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the method of adoption. Prior Period Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. 11 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Note 2.

Revenue Backlog As of September 30, 2025, we had $ 157.7 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitm ents in customer contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to r ecognize just over 55 % of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driv en by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google s ubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $ 6.0 billion, of which $ 4.1 billion was recognized as revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Total deferred revenue as of September 30, 2025 was $ 7.4 billion. Note 3. Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within 12 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. The following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions): As of December 31, 2024 Fair Value Hierarchy Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities Fair value changes recorded in other comprehensive income Time deposits Level 2 $ 2,217 $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,217 $ 2,081 $ 136 Government bonds Level 2 27,551 83 ( 214 ) 27,420 50 27,370 Corporate debt securities Level 2 18,300 79 ( 222 ) 18,157 0 18,157 ",

Alphabet Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and services, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025. We have made estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the SEC. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard, which is effective for our 2025 annual period, can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and we are currently assessing which method to adopt. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\u2019s expenses. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures. Prior Period Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. 11 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Note 2.

Revenue Backlog As of June 30, 2025, we had $ 108.2 billion of remaining performance obligations (\u201crevenue backlog\u201d), primarily related to Google Cloud. Revenue backlog represents commitm ents in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to r ecognize approximately 55 % of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts. Deferred Revenues We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google s ubscriptions, platforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $ 6.0 billion, of which $ 3.5 billion was recognized as revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025. Total deferred revenue as of June 30, 2025 was $ 6.8 billion. Note 3. Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within 12 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc. Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. The following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions): As of December 31, 2024 Fair Value Hierarchy Adjusted Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities Fair value changes recorded in other comprehensive income Time deposits Level 2 $ 2,217 $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,217 $ 2,081 $ 136 Government bonds Level 2 27,551 83 ( 214 ) 27,420 50 27,370 Corporate debt securities Level 2 18,300 79 ( 222 ) 18,157 0 18,157 Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities Level 2 14,437 63 ( 385 ) 14,115 0 14,115 Total investments with fair value change reflected in other comprehensive income (1) 62,505 225 ( 821 ) 61,909 2,131 59,778 Fair value adjustments recorded in net income Money market funds Level 1 8,154 8,154 0 Current marketable equity securities (2) Level 1 4,708 0 4,708 Mutual funds Level 2 105 0 105 Government bonds Level 2 2,035 696 1,339 Corporate debt securities Level 2 3,037 78 2,959 Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities Level 2 3,302 0 3,302 Total investments with fair value change recorded in net income 21,341 8,928 12,413 Cash 0 12,407 0 Total $ 62,505 $ 225 $ ( 821 ) $ 83,250 $ 23,466 $ 72,191 (1) Represents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).
