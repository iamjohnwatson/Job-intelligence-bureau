The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 26, 2025 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025. Certain balances from the prior fiscal year have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Significant Accounting Policies There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025. Fiscal Year Fiscal years 2026 and 2025 are both 52-week years ending on the last Sunday in January. The third quarters of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were both 13-week quarters. Principles of Consolidation Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments, investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other charges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We are currently assessing the effect of the adoption of this standard on our disclosures that will be included in the fiscal year 2026 annual report. In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis, including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each income statement expense caption, as applicable. We will adopt this standard in the fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures. Note 2 - Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense includes restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. 9 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized into inventory, as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Oct 26, 2025 Oct 27, 2024 Oct 26, 2025 Oct 27, 2024 (In millions) Cost of revenue $ 70 $ 50 $ 192 $ 125 Research and development 1,206 910 3,460 2,469 Sales, general and administrative 379 292 1,101 822 Total $ 1,655 $ 1,252 $ 4,753 $ 3,416 Equity Award Activity The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share (In millions, except per share data) Balance as of Jan 26, 2025 274 $ 44.75 Granted 52 $ 114.76 Vested ( 116 ) $ 37.30 Canceled and forfeited ( 7 ) $ 55.62 Balance as of Oct 26, 2025 203 $ 66.59 As of October 26, 2025, aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense was $ 13.1 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and one year for ESPP. Note 3 - Net Income Per Share The following is the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Oct 26, 2025 Oct 27, 2024 Oct 26, 2025 Oct 27, 2024 (In millions, except per share data) Numerator: Net income $ 31,910 $ 19,309 $ 77,107 $ 50,789 Denominator: Basic weighted average shares 24,327 24,533 24,378 24,577 Dilutive impact of outstanding equity awards 156 241 164 260 Diluted weighted average shares 24,483 24,774 24,542 24,837 Net income per share: Basic (1) $ 1.31 $ 0.79 $ 3.16 $ 2.07 Diluted (2) $ 1.30 $ 0.78 $ 3.14 $ 2.04 Anti-dilutive equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share 6 9 20 72 (1) Net income divided by basic weighted average shares. (2) Net income divided by diluted weighted average shares. Diluted net income per share was computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. 10 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 4 - Income Taxes Income tax expense was $ 6.0 billion and $ 3.0 billion for the third quarter, and $ 13.9 billion and $ 8.0 billion for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 15.9 % and 13.5 % for the third quarter, and 15.3 % and 13.6 % for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and U.S. federal research tax credit relative to the increase in income before income tax. Our effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from foreign-derived deduction eligible income, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit. In July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was enacted into law and contains several changes to key U.S. federal income tax laws. We have recognized the tax effects of currently effective OBBBA provisions, which are not material and are reflected in our results for the first nine months of fiscal year 2026. Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all available information. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2023 and 2024. 11 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 5 - Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The fair values of our financial assets are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or market prices of similar assets from active markets.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 26, 2025 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025. Certain balances from the prior fiscal year have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Significant Accounting Policies There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2025. Fiscal Year Fiscal years 2026 and 2025 are both 52-week years ending on the last Sunday in January. The second quarters of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were both 13-week quarters. Principles of Consolidation Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments, investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other charges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures, including disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2026 annual report. We are currently assessing the effect of the adoption of this standard on our disclosures that will be included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 25, 2026. In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis, including, among other items, the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each income statement expense caption, as applicable. We will adopt this standard in our fiscal year 2028 annual report. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than additional disclosures. Note 2 - Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation expense includes restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units, or PSUs, market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. 9 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts capitalized into inventory, as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Jul 27, 2025 Jul 28, 2024 Jul 27, 2025 Jul 28, 2024 (In millions) Cost of revenue $ 58 $ 40 $ 123 $ 75 Research and development 1,191 832 2,254 1,559 Sales, general and administrative 375 282 722 530 Total $ 1,624 $ 1,154 $ 3,099 $ 2,164 Equity Award Activity The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share (In millions, except per share data) Balance as of Jan 26, 2025 274 $ 44.75 Granted 48 $ 108.52 Vested ( 78 ) $ 36.00 Canceled and forfeited ( 5 ) $ 52.34 Balance as of Jul 27, 2025 239 $ 60.19 As of July 27, 2025, aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense was $ 14.0 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.2 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and one year for ESPP. Note 3 - Net Income Per Share The following is the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Jul 27, 2025 Jul 28, 2024 Jul 27, 2025 Jul 28, 2024 (In millions, except per share data) Numerator: Net income $ 26,422 $ 16,599 $ 45,197 $ 31,480 Denominator: Basic weighted average shares 24,366 24,578 24,404 24,599 Dilutive impact of outstanding equity awards 166 270 167 270 Diluted weighted average shares 24,532 24,848 24,571 24,869 Net income per share: Basic (1) $ 1.08 $ 0.68 $ 1.85 $ 1.28 Diluted (2) $ 1.08 $ 0.67 $ 1.84 $ 1.27 Anti-dilutive equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share 3 5 60 68 (1) Net income divided by basic weighted average shares. (2) Net income divided by diluted weighted average shares. Diluted net income per share was computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. 10 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 4 - Income Taxes Income tax expense was $ 4.8 billion and $ 2.6 billion for the second quarter, and $ 7.9 billion and $ 5.0 billion for the first half, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 15.3 % and 13.6 % for the second quarter, and 14.9 % and 13.7 % for the first half, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in tax benefit from foreign-derived deduction eligible income. Our effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from foreign-derived deduction eligible income, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit. In July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was enacted into law and contains several changes to key U.S. federal income tax laws. As of July 27, 2025, we have recognized the tax effects of certain OBBBA provisions, which did not have a material impact on our second quarter. Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all available information. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. 11 NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited) Note 5 - Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The fair values of our financial assets are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or market prices of similar assets from active markets.
