The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The interim consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The interim consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the periods presented. The consolidated results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or for any other future years or interim periods. Reclassifications Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Revenue Recognition Revenue by source The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 2024 2025 2024 Automotive sales $ 20,359 $ 18,831 $ 49,071 $ 53,821 Automotive regulatory credits 417 739 1,451 2,071 Energy generation and storage sales 3,281 2,228 8,548 6,616 Services and other 3,475 2,790 9,159 7,686 Total revenues from sales and services 27,532 24,588 68,229 70,194 Automotive leasing 429 446 1,311 1,380 Energy generation and storage leasing 134 148 386 409 Total revenues $ 28,095 $ 25,182 $ 69,926 $ 71,983 Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Deferred revenue related to the access to our Full Self-Driving (\u201cFSD\u201d) (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales amounted to $ 3.83 billion and $ 3.60 billion as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. 10 Table of Contents Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 619 million and $ 711 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2025, we expect to recognize $ 880 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period. We have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our automotive deliveries. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had current net financing receivables of $ 231 million and $ 247 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $ 612 million and $ 821 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. We offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . We receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual or determined residual value at the end of the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under these programs to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale value guarantee liabilities. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total recorded guarantee liabilities on vehicles sold under these programs were immaterial as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Our maximum exposure on the guarantees we provide if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual residual value at the end of the lease term was $ 3.14 billion and $ 1.45 billion as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Automotive Regulatory Credits As of September 30, 2025, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 3.27 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 877 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. Changes in regulations on automotive regulatory credits may significantly impact our remaining performance obligations and revenue to be recognized under these contracts. In 2025, governmental and regulatory actions have repealed and/or restricted certain regulatory credit programs tied to our products, contributing to the $ 1.41 billion decrease in our remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024. Automotive Leasing Revenue Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program Lease receivables relating to sales-type leases are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions): September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Gross lease receivables $ 317 $ 484 Unearned interest income ( 19 ) ( 38 ) Allowance for expected credit losses ( 6 ) ( 6 ) Net investment in sales-type leases $ 292 $ 440 Reported as: Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 137 $ 152 Other non-current assets 155 288 Net investment in sales-type leases $ 292 $ 440 11 Table of Contents Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are primarily related to prepayments from customers, which is recognized as revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 2.41 billion and $ 1.77 billion, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 1.33 billion and $ 1.09 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected contract length of one year or less. As of September 30, 2025, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 9.71 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 5.22 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. Changes in government and economic incentives or tariffs may impact the transaction price or our ability to execute these existing contracts. We have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our energy products. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had current net financing receivables of $ 38 million and $ 34 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $ 703 million and $ 658 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company\u2019s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information. Our provision for income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.

Revenue Recognition Revenue by source The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions): Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2025 2024 2025 2024 Automotive sales $ 15,787 $ 18,530 $ 28,712 $ 34,990 Automotive regulatory credits 439 890 1,034 1,332 Energy generation and storage sales 2,646 2,866 5,267 4,388 Services and other 3,046 2,608 5,684 4,896 Total revenues from sales and services 21,918 24,894 40,697 45,606 Automotive leasing 435 458 882 934 Energy generation and storage leasing 143 148 252 261 Total revenues $ 22,496 $ 25,500 $ 41,831 $ 46,801 Automotive Segment Automotive Sales Deferred revenue related to the access to our Full Self-Driving (\u201cFSD\u201d) (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales amounted to $ 3.75 billion and $ 3.60 billion as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. 10 Table of Contents Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 428 million and $ 482 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2025, we expect to recognize $ 831 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period. We have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our automotive deliveries. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had current net financing receivables of $ 236 million and $ 247 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $ 670 million and $ 821 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. We offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . We receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual or determined residual value at the end of the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under these programs to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale value guarantee liabilities. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total recorded guarantee liabilities on vehicles sold under these programs were immaterial as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Our maximum exposure on the guarantees we provide if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual residual value at the end of the lease term was $ 2.46 billion and $ 1.45 billion as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Automotive Regulatory Credits As of June 30, 2025, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 3.47 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 880 million in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. Recent governmental and regulatory actions have repealed and/or restricted certain regulatory credit programs tied to our products, contributing to the $ 1.11 billion decrease in our remaining performance obligations as of June 30, 2025 compared to March 31, 2025. Additionally, changes in regulations on automotive regulatory credits may significantly impact our remaining performance obligations and revenue to be recognized under these contracts. Automotive Leasing Revenue Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program Lease receivables relating to sales-type leases are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions): June 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Gross lease receivables $ 382 $ 484 Unearned interest income ( 25 ) ( 38 ) Allowance for expected credit losses ( 6 ) ( 6 ) Net investment in sales-type leases $ 351 $ 440 Reported as: Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 152 $ 152 Other non-current assets 199 288 Net investment in sales-type leases $ 351 $ 440 11 Table of Contents Energy Generation and Storage Segment Energy Generation and Storage Sales We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are primarily related to prepayments from customers, which is recognized as revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $ 2.10 billion and $ 1.77 billion, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $ 944 million and $ 873 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected contract length of one year or less. As of June 30, 2025, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $ 10.38 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $ 5.47 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. Changes in government and economic incentives or tariffs may impact the transaction price or our ability to execute these existing contracts. We have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our energy products. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had current net financing receivables of $ 35 million and $ 34 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and $ 684 million and $ 658 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company\u2019s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information. Our provision for income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.
